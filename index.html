        This is me! I'm 16 years old and, I'm currently a rising junior
        attending Clements Highschool! My favorite subjects are Math
        and Computer Science. I love meeting with new people and learning
        about their various backgrounds. I am always looking for new
        opportunities to change the community and world!

        I also enjoy playing golf! I started playing golf in 2018
        when my dad introduced me to the game. Now, I'm currently
        a member of the Clements Varsity Highschool Golf Team. Aside
        from school competition, I often compete in local tournaments
        such as the TJGT (Texas Junior Golf Tour) and STJPGA (Southern
        Texas Junior Professional Golf Association). I intend to play
        golf for as long as I live!

    <pre class="chess"><img class="chessPic"src="Chess.jpg" alt="ChessBoard" width="150" height="200">
        I also have a strong hobby in playing chess. I started
        playing Chess when I was in kindergarten since my brother
        and dad taught me. I'm a four time state grade level champion
        in Texas (3rd,4th,5th, and 6th). Aside from local and state
        competition, I also competed in various national and international
        events. I was one of two representatives for Texas in the National
        Barber Chess Tournament during 2018 in Wisconsin! I also had a
        best 7th place finish in the USCF National K-12 Chess Championship
        in Nashville! Lastly, I was also a part of the U8 US Chess team
        to compete in the World Youth Chess Championship in Greece during
        2015.
